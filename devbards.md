## Notes

<!-- Content_START -->

### 2025.02.06

I had finished week 0 and week 1 study materials.
Like what Mario said, the first five weeks are about the introduction of Enthereum.
That is, I would be able to write some code after that.

-- one take away daily --
The Merkle Tree calculates the hash value by combining each node with its neighboring node to generate the parent node value.
This means that checking the final node value can be used to verify the entire tree.
Any change to a node will result in a different hash value, making it impossible to pass verification.
It is a fundamental mechanism in cryptocurrencies.
